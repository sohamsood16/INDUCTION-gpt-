DAWN OF A NEW JOURNEY — July 31, 2025
The sun had barely risen when on July 31, 2025, I—Soham Sood, a hopeful student from a quiet district in Haryana—stepped out of my comfort zone and into the vast world that awaited at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC), Ludhiana. As I flipped the page to this exciting new chapter, I felt both exhilarated and nervous—but more than anything, grateful.

A Spiritual Beginning
My day began at 8:30 AM inside the serene Gurudwara Sahib on campus—a spiritual anchor that calmed me instantly. Surrounded by fellow newcomers, I joined in the Jap Ji Sahib, guided by the granthi’s soothing voice. The beautiful kirtan from a local Ludhiana jatha washed over us, weaving threads of calm and connection among strangers. All the jitters melted away. A heartfelt Ardaas followed—prayer for strength, humility, and clarity as we stepped onto the campus path ahead.

Sweet Moments in the Morning
By 10:00 AM, we were released from the spiritual gathering. Outside, near the hostel complex, we were greeted with refreshments laid out with thoughtful care. A cup of warmth and a few friendly faces helped spark new conversations, forming the first bonds of camaraderie.

Gathering in the Grand Auditorium
As refreshing as the morning had been, nothing prepared me for the grandeur of GNDEC’s auditorium. Soft‑padded seats, gentle air conditioning, and an ambience more akin to a cinema than a lecture hall—all hints that our college journey would be something extraordinary.

The stage lit up under the guidance of Taran Ma'am, Convener of the Causmic Club, whose warm and confident presence effortlessly set the tone. She welcomed us with a smile, launching into the story of GNDEC’s legacy—an institution born in 1956 to uplift rural youth with technical education

Voices of Inspiration
One by one, distinguished voices took the stage:

Sir Harsimran Singh Jaggi walked us through GNDEC’s pride and glory—its academic traditions and reputation for nurturing innovators. You could see curiosity spark in the eyes of the audience.

A video by Sangam Arora, a former CSE topper, urged us to balance books with real-world skills. He reminded us, “In today’s world, skills are what shape your success.”

We watched another video featuring Arshpreet Singh, now an automation engineer at Airtel India, who shared insights on setting goals, navigating challenges, and staying focused as we carve our paths.

Academic Foundations & Support
Next, Dean of Academics, Akshay Girdhar Sir explained the college’s curriculum, examination patterns, and the guidance system in place—reassuring us that help would always be at hand if we ever felt lost in the maze of assignments or deadlines.

The HOD of Student Welfare took the microphone soon after. With a calm demeanor, he addressed pressing questions, offering peace of mind and a genuine promise that our concerns would be heard and supported.

The moment then came to hear from Principal Sehijpal Singh Ji, whose address brimmed with warmth and vision. He spoke of the vast opportunities that await at GNDEC if we dare to dream and work hard. A gentle encouragement echoed in his words: “You’re here to grow—not just as engineers, but as thoughtful, skilled human beings.”

Finally, KS Maan Sir, HOD of the IT department, rounded off the session by walking us through our academic journey ahead—project work, lab practices, and building a foundation that could withstand the tests of industry and innovation.

REFLECTION ON THE FIRST STEPS
Walking out after the official welcome, I found myself enveloped in gratitude and inspiration. From the spiritual grounding at the gurudwara to the uplifting messages in the auditorium, each moment left a unique imprint on my heart.

I realized:

Community matters—the ritual of worship connected us in a way that IDs or names never could.

Heritage inspires—knowing GNDEC’s six‑decade tradition gave weight to our own steps forward.

Balance is crucial—alumni stories taught us that education isn’t just theory—it’s about building relevant skills and character.

Support is real—faculty reaffirmed again and again that help isn’t far away, whether academic, personal, or professional.
